# Monopoly-Game
My first CPP project.
It is user friendly, user interactice monopoly game.
You just need two dice(don't worry if you don' have them. I have a code for that too :p) and this application/code to play one of the interesting multiplayer games.
It's a pure terminal application. So, don't expect any graphics please. :)
Please let me know if there are any bugs in the application.
